					<h1>Conservation Halton</h1>
					<p>
						Conservation Halton has a complex flood management system that is vital to their operations. 
						The largest contributor to annual disaster recovery costs in Canada is damages from flooding, 
						and Ontario conservation authorities are tasked with managing and monitoring watersheds to provide 
						flood forecasting, emergency planning, flood mitigation, 
						and community planning to reduce the extent and damages caused by these flooding events.

					<h1>The Problem</h1>
					<p>
						The current public facing web application, <a href="http://camaps.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=a2928bf280194294a4027111f8ff284a">
						a planning and permits web application</a>, has been determined to be too technical and 
						not user-friendly for residents looking for basic information about their property. 
						Additionally, the technology this web application was built 
						with (ESRI’s Web AppBuilder) is now out of date and a newer solution (ESRI’s Experience Builder) 
						is available. Internally, there is currently no interactive application dedicated to assessing 
						flood exposure and vulnerability for various the various watersheds and municipalities.

		<h1>The Proposal</h1>
			<p>
				It has been determined that new web applications that can visualize data related 
				to flood exposure and vulnerability would be beneficial in making management decisions. 
				This would allow Conservation Halton to make more informed decisions for development and planning emergency responses, 
				and for the public to stay informed regarding risks affecting their properties.
			</p>
			<p>Two web applications have been proposed to solve this problem:
			<ul>
				<li>An application that would allow the public to view their properties and flood risk data associated with their location</li>
				<li>An internal dashboard that will display statistics for regions such as watershed boundaries, subwatershed boundaries, or municipal boundaries. </li>
			</ul>
