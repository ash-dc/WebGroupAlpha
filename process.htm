            <h1>Data Pre-Proccessing</h1>
            <p> For this project we relied on open source data and generating mock data to use to demo the information that could be displayed. Watershed, subwatershed, 
                and Conservation halton boundaries were taken from <a href="https://conservationhalton-camaps.opendata.arcgis.com/">Conservation Haltons Open Datahub</a>. 
                Watercourse data and municipal boundaries were gathered from <a href= "https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/">Ontario Geohub</a> and clipped to the study area. Building footprints were gathered from <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CanadianBuildingFootprints">Microsoft</a>. 
                Mock building types and their associated risk scores were generated for each of the building footprints. Mock floodplains were generated using 10m, 30m, and 50m buffers around the water course.

            <p> Experience builder was found to be the most up to date and appropriate enviroment to create a simple web applicationtion 
                that would allow public users to view their properties and the associated flood risk. 2 options were created initially to 
                explore functionality and determine what the final solution would look like.

                            Using the projected data layers collected by the group, the buildings were clipped within 
                            the 50m flood plain. All analysis and symbology was completed in ArcGIS Pro. Once the ArcGIS 
                            Pro document was published to ArcGIS Online, data was added to a new Experience. A template 
                            titled Jewelry Box was used to create this app. Several widgets were used to visualize the data,
                            including a map widget to view data layers, a list widget to view and zoom to the watersheds within
                            the study area, and the map layers widget allowing the user to turn layers on and off within the map.
                            Additionally, a feature info widget was used to view details of and zoom to buildings within the 50m 
                            flood plain. Text and pictures were used to enhance and customize the appearance of the app for Conservation Halton.

                           This prototype used the same raw data from the group.The building count in every watershed was formulated using
                           the Summarize Within Tool. The symbology and analysis was again, completed in ArcGIS Pro. The ArcGIS Pro document
                           was published to ArcGIS Online and a new Experience was created. A Blank template was used and a map widget was used 
                           to visualize the data.A Feature Info Widget was used to view information(building count) about each watershed. The
                           Widget was also configured to zoom to the watershed on it's selection. The Legend widget was fit into the display.
                           A Share widget was placed into the map section for additional functionality. A filter widget was added to filter

            <p> To create an internal solution that could display numerous statistics and calculations, Operations Dashboard was
                determined to be the best platform. 3 preliminary dashboard options were created to explore functionality and

                            This operations dashboard focused on utilizing mock data regarding building types and their associated risk to
                             attempt to compute a more complex vulnerability calculation. <br />An indicator widget was used to count the number 
                             of affected buildings (overlapping the 50m flood plain data) within the viewshed of the map. A pie chart widget 
                             summarized the classification of each of the affected buildings. Finally, a gauge widget was used to attempt to 
                             calculate a simple vulnerability indicator. The gauge sums the risk scores (based on building type, ranging from 
                             1 to 3 with 3 being the most vulnerable) of buildings within the flood plain and divides by the total number of 
                             buildings in the area. <br />However, there were errors with the data sets being used that prevented this widget from 
                             calculating accurately. Other limitations of this application are an inability to view these statistics by watershed or municipality.

                            This operations dashboard uses pre-processed data from a web map created in AGOL. The summarize within tool was used to find areas in 
                            square meters of building polygons that are within the flood buffer zones for 3 buffer distances: 10m, 30m, 50m. The Web Map displays 
                            the areas of risk associated with the total area of house polygons (in Sq. Meters) within a stretch of the river segment. This allows 
                            users to easily see what areas have a higher risk for a 10m, 30m, or 50m flood buffer around the river. Sub watersheds where symbolized 
                            to show each of the different watershed zones. This is for environmentalists or the conservation authority to see what watersheds have 
                            more risk of flood damage to buildings. When developing the Pie chart, The category field was configured to display the 7 largest Watersheds, 
                            opposed to all for simplicity and clarity. Functionality was added to the pie chart so users can click a pie segment and it will zoom to 
                            the watershed selected, flash, and display it on the map. It also shows a popup of information related to that area of watershed. 
                            Unclicking the pie segment brings the map back to the default extent.

                                    This option underwent preprocessing in ArcGIS online to determine the Building Footprint Area within 
                                    each watershed of the Conservation Halton jurisdiction. The Summarize Within tool was used to calculate
                                     this statistic and was displayed in the Dashboard using the indicator widget. The indicator widget is 
                                     based on a transparent Building Footprint Summary layer. Arrows within the indicator tool can be clicked
                                      to cycle through the various watersheds. The indicator also filters as the map pans and zooms so that 
                                      only visible watersheds can be displayed within the indicator. The indicator can be filtered further 
                                      by using the select tool in the top left corner of the WebMap. 
                                    This will allow the user to select a watershed and retrieve its name and building area summary.

                            Initially JavaScript 3.31 was used to compare with 4.14. 
                            It was determined that JS 4.14 had far better functionality 
                            and appeared less restrictive for coding in widgets such as scale bar, 
                            search bar, and on click address locator. The dashboard created with 3.31 
                            is a simple interface that allows the user to click directly on the flood
                            zones and watersheds to retrieve information about them. A div was used

                            4.14 was found to be much easier to code and had helpful JavaScript tutorials.
                            Firstly, a code was developed that inserted a legend with a scroll bar and a layers 
                            list that allows the user to toggle on and off the layers they want to see. Next, 
                            all the new widgets were inserted to the required and function area of the code for 
                            it to display properly. After this a popup widget was inserted to show the longitude 
                            and latitude, as well as the scale of the map which changes automatically as the 
                            cursor moves over the map. A search section was also created to allow the user to 
                            search their address and see if it is in a flood zone by referencing the Flood Risk Layer. 
                            Finally, the most useful part of the app was the onclick address locator coded so users can click an area
                            anywhere in the flood area and receive the address and postal code of that area.
