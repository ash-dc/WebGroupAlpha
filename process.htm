            <h1>ESRI's Experience Builder</h1>
            <p> Experience builder was found to be the most up to date and appropriate enviroment to create a simple web applicationtion 
                that would allow public users to view their properties and the associated flood risk. 2 options were created initially to 
                explore functionality and determine what the final solution would look like.

                            Using the projected data layers collected by the group, the buildings were clipped within 
                            the 50m flood plain. All analysis and symbology was completed in ArcGIS Pro. Once the ArcGIS 
                            Pro document was published to ArcGIS Online, data was added to a new Experience. A template 
                            titled Jewelry Box was used to create this app. Several widgets were used to visualize the data,
                            including a map widget to view data layers, a list widget to view and zoom to the watersheds within
                            the study area, and the map layers widget allowing the user to turn layers on and off within the map.
                            Additionally, a feature info widget was used to view details of and zoom to buildings within the 50m 
                            flood plain. Text and pictures were used to enhance and customize the appearance of the app for Conservation Halton.

            <p> To create an internal solution that could display numerous statistics and calculations, Operations Dashboard was
                determined to be the best platform. 3 preliminary dashboard options were created to explore functionality and

                            This operations dashboard focused on utilizing mock data regarding building types and their associated risk to
                             attempt to compute a more complex vulnerability calculation. <br />An indicator widget was used to count the number 
                             of affected buildings (overlapping the 50m flood plain data) within the viewshed of the map. A pie chart widget 
                             summarized the classification of each of the affected buildings. Finally, a gauge widget was used to attempt to 
                             calculate a simple vulnerability indicator. The gauge sums the risk scores (based on building type, ranging from 
                             1 to 3 with 3 being the most vulnerable) of buildings within the flood plain and divides by the total number of 
                             buildings in the area. <br />However, there were errors with the data sets being used that prevented this widget from 
                             calculating accurately. Other limitations of this application are an inability to view these statistics by watershed or municipality.
